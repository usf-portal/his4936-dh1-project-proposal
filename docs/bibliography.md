# Bibliography

Remember to make full use of Markdown format. You can use two asterices to
make text **bold**. More importantly for Chicago Style format, you should use
a single astrix to make text *italicized*, which you should use for book
titles. Remember to use Markdown to create links to any web resources in your
bibliography.
