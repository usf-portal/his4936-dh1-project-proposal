The data on this web source will enable our group to make a visual representation of how many American soldiers died during the attack at Pearl Harbor. The casualties at Pearl Harbor are before America declared war on Japan and will be supporting evidence to our proposal.

This source is the speech given by President Roosevelt to congress declaring war on Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbor. This source is significant because not only is it a primary source, though also a timeline of events for America joining the war in Europe.

4.	"Introduction." National WWII Memorial. Accessed July 11, 2018. https://www.wwiimemorial.com/Registry/Default.aspx. 

This data set will provide our group with information regarding how many soldiers are officially memorialized and accounted for after the war. We will use the data to either enhance or contrast our statistics given by each state.

5.	Lewis, Adrian R. "The Failure of Allied Planning and Doctrine for Operation Overlord: The Case of Minefield and Obstacle Clearance." The Journal of Military History 62, no. 4 (1998): 787-807. doi:10.2307/120178. https://www-jstor-org.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/stable/120178?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=Omaha&searchText=beach&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3DOmaha%2Bbeach%2B&refreqid=search%3Ab52197ba5c80b66d1f08c37d8fd7dc4e&seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents 

This Jstor article goes in depth on some of the reasons the Omaha beach invasion saw so many American and Allied casualties. 

6.	"Research Starters: US Military by the Numbers." The National WWII Museum | New Orleans. Accessed July 11, 2018. https://www.nationalww2museum.org/students-teachers/student-resources/research-starters/research-starters-us-military-numbers

This website shows all the “number” pertaining to US soldiers in the military. It has an excellent timeline as well as full lists of personnel, profile of servicemen, minority participation, and casualties by branch. 

7.	"The American Economy during World War II." EHnet. Accessed July 11, 2018. https://eh.net/encyclopedia/the-american-economy-during-world-war-ii/. 

This source gives crucial data to the amount of federal spending and military spending from the year1940 until 1945. This data can be used to see when the most money was spent in the United States in regard to the costs of soldiers and equipment.

8.	"WWII Army and Army Air Force Casualties." National Archives and Records Administration. Accessed July 11, 2018. https://www.archives.gov/research/military/ww2/army-casualties.

The National Archives splits their database of WWII casualties up into two links. This first link carries the list of casualties from the Army and Airforce specifically. It is important because although the list is by state, it is tallied by county of each state which is a good source for diving a little deeper into where these casualties were from and sorting by county can possibly answer a few more questions than knowing just the state. 

9.	"World War II Casualties: Table of Contents." National Archives and Records Administration. Accessed July 11, 2018. https://www.archives.gov/research/military/ww2/navy-casualties. 

The second database which is separate from the Army and Airforce database on the National Archives website carries the list of casualties from the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard. This database is a little different whereas it does not specify the county of the deceased but it does specify their home address which we presume could possibly be scraped or used to find counties if we go that route. 

10.	"World War 2 Statistics." World War 2. Accessed July 11, 2018. http://www.world-war-2.info/statistics/. 

The World War II statistics data set will allow our group to compare American fatalities to the number of fatalities in other countries during the war.
