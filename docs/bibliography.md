# Bibliography

Remember to make full use of Markdown format. You can use two asterices to
make text **bold**. More importantly for Chicago Style format, you should use
a single astrix to make text *italicized*, which you should use for book
titles. Remember to use Markdown to create links to any web resources in your
bibliography.

Below are a few examples

*[http://www.healthdata.org/mexico?language=41]
...This website source will be used to gather information on the different death rates and thier causes. This is a data base that has a good amount of information that is detailed and presented in a great visual way.
*[https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/jan/14/mexico-drug-war-murders-map#dataChaniotis]
...This source focuses more on the drug war murders committed, which I will use to gather information. Since it is an online news publication, the Guardian, they had to get their information from somewhere and I also downloaded that information to analyze.
*[https://esoc.princeton.edu/country/mexicoClinton]
...This source comes from the Empirical Studies of Conflict from Princeton and has infromation from various countries, like other sources on this list. This webpage also is a database of information that gives out more information on Mexico regarding its geography, demographics, and infrastructure. Not just the deaths and what caused them. This will help me give a more well rounded answer to the questions I asked in the proposal, since I will be able to connect the deaths to other, broader information.
*[http://secretariadoejecutivo.gob.mx/incidencia-delictiva/incidencia-delictiva-victimas.php]
...This is an important webpage compared to the other sources. This is because it is the official Mexican government website. I will and have downloaded the information on this webpage and the information that they have goes back to 2014.  I will analyze and clean up this information using OpenRefine. Although it is in Spanish, I will be able to translate it into English.
* [https://elcri.men/en/Coward]
* ...This website is orginally in Spanish but the author also has a version of it in English, which can be helpful. I will use this website to like the others gather information and bring all of it together and synthesize it into one cohesive visualization. This website also has downloadable information.
*[http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/countries/mexico]
...This website looks towards HIV and AIDS, although they are only estimates that the webpage gives it can be a valuable source going forward. Again, like many of the sources I have found, this allows the information that has been gathered to be downloaded. I also know this as accurate as information I can get, in terms of gathering information on HIV and AIDS, since that is the sole focus of this group and it is from the UN.
*[http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/mexico-population/]
...This website, like some of the others, gives general information. Meaning it can be compared with those other sources, which will allow me to give more accurate information.
*[http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/04/23/v-mexico-by-the-numbers/]
...I used this source for the data source analysis assignment and it has helped look at the other sources I have listed with hopefully a better judgement on wether or not it is first of all relaible and accurate, since the authors give show their sources and I am able to look at the same information they did when creating this webpage. 

If you want, you can break your bibliography into different sections, for example, one section for traditional historiography, and another for digitally related works. You do not have to do this though.
