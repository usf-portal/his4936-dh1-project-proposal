Agyemang, Kwame J. A. and John N. Singer. "Race in the Present Day: NBA Employees Sound Off on Race and Racism." *Journal of African American Studies* 18, no. 1 (2014): 11-32.

Agyemang and Singer's journal article relates to my research because it discusses racism against black NBA players, as many were to known to the white sponsors as "high-salaried, drug-sniffing black guys." The article also relates to my research because Agyemang and Singer discuss the double standard that black male athletes have, and they used LeBron James as an example because he was a black athlete that was beloved by many fans, but as soon as he left the Cleveland Cavaliers to go to the Miami Heat, he became one of the, if not the, most hated basketball players. Agyemang and Singer also state that Cleveland's owner, Dan Gilbert, and his negative comments about LeBron's "betrayal" was like a slave master seeing his slave runaway.

Farred's book is important to my research because he explains that racism, though getting better, still exists in sports.

She makes the correlation that during the time of slavery blacks worked for their white masters, to today's black athletes performing for a majority white audience and are managed under teams that are mostly owned by white people, and this is summed up by a phrase that Griffin uses: "Black bodies, White rules."

In Wright's journal article, he discusses the dilemma NBA players face of either following the path of Michael Jordan, failing to follow Jordan, or creating their own career path in the NBA. Wright's article relates to my research because he explains that even though Michael Jordan is a role model for basketball players, he failed to create a social change in the world. This idea causes athletes to think about their decisions involving topics such as race and beliefs because they can either strive for greatness, or strive to change the world.
