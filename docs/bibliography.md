* Brown, Elspeth. “The LGBT Oral History Digital Collaboratory.” LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory, University of Toronto, 2017, lgbtqdigitalcollaboratory.org/.
	* We plan to use this collection of digital projects as inspiration for our own pilot project based on the same subject matter. We hope to learn from mistakes others have made within their own projects, as well as replicate the methods that were most successful.

* Calonico, Scott, director. *When AIDS Was Funny*, Vanity Fair, 26 May 2017, vanityfair.com/news/2015/11/reagan-administration-response-to-aids-crisis.
	* This source helps to put the subject of our pilot project into a historical context. It reveals the political and social climate the oral histories we’re analyzing are referencing to. Additionally, it provided great motivation to examine the topic of the ACT UP movement more in depth.

* Carroll, Tamar W. *Mobilizing New York: AIDS, Antipoverty, and Feminist Activism*. University of North Carolina Press, 2015.
	* We hope that this source will also provide additional context for LGBT social movements. Specifically, the impact they have on their communities and how they build up to creating massive social change.

* Cohen, Peter Franzblau. *Love and Anger Essays on AIDS, Activism, and Politics*. Routledge, 2013.
	* This source examines literary works surrounding AIDS activism and includes several scholarly fictional works alongside interviews with activists to broaden readers’ understanding of AIDS activism. We intend to use this source to further our understanding of the ACT UP group, and therefore put the oral histories into a more educated context.

* Gould, Deborah B. *Moving Politics: Emotion and Act Up's Fight Against AIDS*. University of Chicago Press, 2009.
	* Gould’s work is rare within our sources in that it emphases the emotional ramifications of ACT UP. We feel that this title along with Sentiment-Analysis within a text analysis  program, such as  Orange 3, we hope to uncover the long term emotional impact on the members of ACT UP, New York.
* Hubbard, Jim, and Sarah Schulman. “ACT UP Oral History Project.” ACTUP Oral History Project, The New York Lesbian & Gay Experimental Film Festival, 2015, actuporalhistory.org/index1.html.
	* As our primary source, this collection of oral histories holds a wealth of information and stories from actual members of ACT UP, New York. Using tools like Webscrapper, Tableu, and various text analysis programs, we will work with the provided transcripts of these interviews in an attempt to create a meaningful analysis of the experience of being in ACT UP, New York.

* Johnson, David K. *The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government*. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2006.
	* This source by a previous professor of ours is a favorite among our sources. While the topic itself is not directly related to our subject material, it provides valuable background on the discrimination and tribulations the LGBT community faced in the Cold War era. Which set the precedent for ACT UP’s primary motivations and goals.

* Kramer, Larry. *Reports from the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist*. New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1989. 
	* Kramer founded ACT UP in 1987, and we believe his book will lead us to wealth of other sources to draw from. Additionally, we believe his perspective and experiences are valuable to us understanding the background on the ACT UP Movement and the experiences of its leadership.

* Rupp, Leila J. *A Desired Past: A Short History of Same-Sex Love in America*. University of Chicago Press, 2002.
	* This is a source that heavily influenced our interest in the topic of LGBT histories. It emphasizes the experiences and tribulations of the LGBT community throughout American history. After reading this book, we were motivated to learn more about these experiences and the impact they have on these individuals.

* Shepard, Benjamin Heim, and Ronald Hayduk, eds. *From ACT UP to the WTO: Urban Protest and Community Building in the Era of Globalization*. New York: Verso, 2002. 
	* This source is a study of militant activism including the tactics used by ACT UP’s founders and discussions of some of the associated breakaway groups. We plan on using this source to broaden our understanding of ACT UP, New York’s history and goals.
