Agyemang and Singer's journal article relates to my research because it discusses racism against black NBA players, as many were to known to the white sponsors as "high-salaried, drug-sniffing black guys."

Agyemang and Singer also state that Cleveland's owner, Dan Gilbert, and his negative comments about LeBron's "betrayal" was like a slave master seeing his slave runaway.

This idea causes athletes to think about their decisions involving topics such as race and beliefs because they can either strive for greatness, or strive to change the world.
