**Stephen DeCasien: 		Cuban Revolution**
1.	https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cu.html
a.	This website gives basic economic information about Cuba. For example, GDP, main exports and imports. Could be scrapped for economic numbers and placed into a spreadsheet to then be made into a comparative visualization along the other revolutions. May need to try and find a source that has more economic information covering multiple years.  
2.	http://database.cubaarchive.org/ and http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/COM.TAB1.GIF
a.	This database gives the number of dead and missing throughout most of Cuban history in the 20th century. Through this data I can breakdown how many people were killed and went missing during the years concerning the Cuban Revolution. This data and be used in comparison with the other revolutions and made into a visualization to help vacillate discussion on the impact of revolutions on the population.
3.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuban_presidential_election,_1958
a.	This Wikipedia page and the rest of the ones concerning elections before, during, and after the Cuban revolution will be spaced so that the impact of the revolution on the political systems of Cuba can be analyzed. Could be used in a visualization later on.
4.	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Cuban_Revolution and https://www.aljazeera.com/focus/2009/07/2009726104942190404.html  
a.	This Wikipedia site gives a good timeline of the Cuban Revolution that can be used in conjunction with the death toll database to create a map of where and when were the battles and mass murders during the Cuban Revolution.
5.	http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/castro/1961/
a.	This database has many of the speeches given by Fidel Castro throughout his life. This site could be scraped and used to find out how many times revolutionary language was used before, during and after the Cuban Revolution.

**Mikey Hall: 			French Revolution**
1.	Doyle, William. *The Oxford History of the French Revolution.* USA: Oxford University Press, 1990.
a.	This book is a general overview of the French Revolution and the major players and events that happened between 1787 and 1799. The author lays out the intentions and actions of the big names of the French Revolution, e.g. Voltaire, and then goes more in-depth into a political analysis of the origins of the French Revolution. This book will be helpful for general information, political motives, and background to the rebellions during the French Revolution.
2.	Greenlaw, Ralph W. "Pamphlet Literature in France during the Period of the Aristocratic Revolt (1787-1788)." *The Journal of Modern History* 29, No. 4 (Dec., 1957): 349-354.
a.	This article discusses the pamphlet literature written during the Aristocratic revolt of 1787-1788 to find what sort of information can be understood about the intentions and causes of the revolt. The short article contains a helpful table that is used to show how the pamphlets seemed to have been used by the aristocrats to push their message about their unfavorable opinions on the royal activities and rule. This will be helpful to understand the underpinnings and beginnings of the French Revolution and the table can be reconfigured in Tableau to give a more dynamic presentation of the data and to possibly better understand the trends of the data provided.
3.	Liberty, Equality, Fraternity website: http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/allfr.html
a.	This website contains 625 primary source documents from the French Revolution, a vast majority of them being engraver images and cartoons, but does also contain translated texts of pamphlets, letters, and other written sources. This website can be of use as it has a timeline of events and the aforementioned collection of primary source documents and images to bolster the presentation and discussion of the French Revolution.
4.	Skocpol, Theda. *States and social revolutions. [electronic resource] : a comparative analysis of France, Russia, and China.* n.p.: Cambridge ; New York : Cambridge University Press, 1979., 1979. University of South Florida Libraries Catalog, EBSCOhost (accessed March 17, 2018).
a.	This book provides a frame of reference for understanding social revolutions through focusing on the role of the state during the collapse and reconstitution of power during revolutions. This work can be useful as it brings in a way to discuss both the Russian and French Revolutions and gives another avenue of analysis for the Cuban Revolution.
5.	http://necrometrics.com/warstatx.htm
a.	This website provides statistical data about the amount of deaths during a staggering amount of different wars, revolutions, genocides, etc. There is very little to no analysis of the data, just numbers with brief data to detail where the information was gathered and the dates that correspond with the data. This website can be useful for detailing out how many deaths happened during the French Revolution and possibly including the Cuban and Russian Revolutions to see how violent and harmful to society at large the revolutions proved to be.

The article contains multiple tables including the national average and net income, population, and the gross agricultural and industrial production.
