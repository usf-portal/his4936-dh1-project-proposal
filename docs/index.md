REPLACE THE INTRO IMAGE WITH ANY IMAGE YOU WISH, OR PUT IMAGES ANYWHERE ELSE,
IF YOU LIKE.

---

REMEMBER TO USE THE [Markdown Cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

FOR ALL EXTERNAL LINKS OR IMAGES, JUST PAST THE URL INSIDE THE PARENTHESES

FOR LOCAL LINKS OR IMAGES, ALL PATHS START FROM THE `docs` DIRECTORY. SO TO
LINK TO ANY IMAGE YOU STORED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE `imgs` DIRECTORY, YOU ONLY
NEED TO MAKE THE PATH LIKE THIS `imgs/some_image.jpg`. NOTE: YOU SHOULD *NOT*
START PATHS WITH A `/`. See the examples above.

WHEN COMPOSING YOUR PROPOSAL REMEMBER YOU CAN...

* Remember that you can...
* Put items in lists
* Even
    * Nested
    * Lists

1. You can also
2. Use numbered
    1. Lists
    2. And Nest them

---

Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

---

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

```

## The Proposal

### Introduction

When most people think of Mexico, they think of either paradise or, for the most part, the murders committed by the cartels and/or law enforcement themselves. Although this is a harsh reality for Mexico's citizens, I will also be taking this into account. I want to focus not only those deaths but those that are caused by diseases, certain conditions, and illnesses along those lines.
For my research topic I wanted to focus on Mexico, but I had a tough time figuring out what the exact topic was going to be. In the end, I decided to try and answer what the big causes of death in Mexico? What cities and/or states were affected the most? And whether that has changed through time? Because I believe these questions, especially the last one, might be difficult to answer if I start from the very beginning, I am focusing on the turn of the century, the beginning of the January 2001 to the latest information I can find. This will allow me to focus and go more in depth if I have some sort of timeline or set of dates. Not to mention that it will, hopefully, be a lot more faster and easier to look up this information since the records might be readily available online. Although there has been a lot of news coverage about the killings done by the cartels and gangs in Mexico, I also know that Mexico used to have one of if not the highest obesity rate in the world, but its citizens have taken steps to try and reduce that rate and statistic, and I wonder if that has helped overall and over time if at all and if it has how has it affected the death rates in terms of illnesses.

### Workflow

I will be using, for the most part, online sources specifically from Mexicoâ€™s government website, which is downloadable for the most part, health organizations websites, like the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) and the Pew Research Center. These online sources will help me build an impartial and unbiased resource which I hopefully will be able to turn into a couple of graphs, bar or line, or pie chart along with a map that will show this information in a condensed form. The OpenRefine program will also make it easier to read, understand and interpret. With this information I plan on using Tableau to create these graphs and/or map, hopefully me being able to download some of this information will make it easier to do that.
I will be working on my own, which I realize is a big undertaking, the main reason being I wanted to focus on Mexico. But I intend to download and/or scrape data, with Web Scraper ,and clean it up, with this being done I would like to create a map of Mexico with all the information being condensed. As well as, hopefully, some kind of charts.

### Scholarship

Here is where you should expand a bit on any relevant scholarship, whether
digital or historical. If you refer to authors in your bibliography, you need
only use parenthetical (author, year) notation. If you are referring to a web
resource, you can always link directly to it.

This section should not be a large histiographical essay going on about the
merits or drawbacks of different individuals. That kind of discussion can go
in your final project. Instead, this should be a place to let your reader know
in the space of several paragraphs the basic schools of thought or important
works of scholarship that relate to your project. More importantly, you can
suggest what (potentially) a digital project such as the one you are proposing
could say to such a debate.

Remember that you can and should talk about both digital and historical
scholarship, when relevant. [Digital Humanities Quarterly](www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/)
is a good starting point.

Rather than think of this as a discussion about others, it might be more
helpful to think of it like this: in academia there are lots of scattered, but
important conversations going on, you can have more impact when you can connect
what you are saying to more and more of these conversations. So, you can think
of it like selling your project by linking it to its possible links to others.
