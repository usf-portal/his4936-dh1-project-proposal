## The Proposal

### Introduction

Basketball is currently one of the most popular sports played and watched worldwide. Basketball was originally invented in the United States in 1891 by James Naismith, and this newfound sport initially consisted of pick-up games, or spontaneous games where group of players would score the basketball in a basketball hoop. Basketball quickly grew popular and a league where teams competed against each other was formed in 1898. The popularity of basketball constantly grew and led to the formation of a new professional league, the National Basketball Association (NBA), in 1946. Another league, the American Basketball Association (ABA), was formed in 1967, however the ABA and NBA later merged together in 1976 under the name of the NBA. Today, the NBA and basketball in general continues to grow thanks to the fans and the players.

In this proposal, I aim to target how key figures, such as Bill Russell and Michael Jordan, helped revolutionize basketball and led the NBA to become what it is today.

Originally basketball began as a white-dominated league with few, if any, minorities. However, this all changed as soon as Bill Russell entered in the NBA. By revolutionizing the league with his size and defense, he became the first black NBA superstar. By also dealing with the criticisms, racist comments, and proving everyone making those comments wrong, Russell opened up a path for black athletes in the NBA. The path opened up by Russell led the NBA to become a black-dominated league, paving the way for future NBA legends such as Wilt Chamberlain, Oscar Robertson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan to become successful in the NBA. Lastly, this Boston Celtics legend has one of the most significant accolade held by a single NBA player, as he played from 1956 to 1969, served as a player and coach from 1966 to 1969, he led his team is eleven championship titles, currently still the most championships won by a single player.

Bill Russell wasn't the only person to pave the way for a non-white race to come into the NBA, as Yao Ming helped bring more Asians into the NBA. Yao destroyed all of the stereotypes of Asians being to small, as this 7'6" giant came into the league as one of the tallest players to ever play in the NBA. Though his career was cut short due to injuries, this Hall of Fame basketball star was able to inspire fellow Asians, such as Yi Jianlian and Jeremy Lin, to attempt a career in the NBA.

![Michael and Scottie](https://mk0slamonlinensgt39k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rsz_gettyimages-71052255.jpg)

Michael Jordan, known to many basketball fans as the GOAT (Greatest-Of-All-Time), was a dominant figure in the NBA in the 1980s and the 1990s. Jordan, along with Hall of Famer Scottie Pippen, led the Chicago Bulls to a total of six NBA Finals appearances, and a total of six championships, therefore being undefeated in an NBA Finals matchup. Michael Jordan not only revolutionized the NBA, he revolutionized the world through Air Jordan, a sub-company of Nike that produces shoes, clothing, and accessories. Air Jordan became the most succesful brand from a basketball player, and inspired other NBA players to create their own shoes and clothing lines.

Lastly, there is the "Black Mamba" Kobe Bryant, and "The King" LeBron James. By following the path that Michael Jordan set for them, these two desired to become the greatest. One step that both Bryant and James took was signing with Nike, thus creating their own signature shoes, which are currently some of the most popular Nike shoes on the market.

### Workflow

For my information sources, I intend on using books from the University of South Florida library and journal articles found on JSTOR on the globalization and rise of popularity of basketball and the NBA, race issues in the NBA, how Bill Russell and Yao Ming helped changed stereotypes on Black and Asian athletes, and how Michael Jordan essentially monopolized the world with Nike and Air Jordan.

For my workflow, I intend to research through and analyze my sources, and gathering information and organizing it into the categories above. For my final website design I intend on having a tab for the early stages of the NBA and the era of Bill Russell, the rise of Michael Jordan, and lastly a section that talks about the modern NBA. For my data research, I initially intended to web-scrape basketball-reference.com, but I realized that DrGuillermo has already done that and posted his data onto kaggle.com (https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats). I intend to use his player data, players, and seasons stats csv files to tackle questions such as what is the average height and weight of an NBA player, the average points an NBA player scores in the NBA, the average amount of years someone stays in the NBA, the ratio of how many players did or didn't go to college before entering the NBA, and the ratios of different races in the NBA. I will also use a dataset created by Gabe Salzer on data.world (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-team-annual-attendance) to examine the annual attendance of fans from 2000 to 2015 in order to analyze the amount of attendees per game, and an estimation of generated income that each team produced from home games. I intend on using another dataset created by Gabe Salzer and Selene Arrazolo (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-players-birthplaces) to analyze each player's birthplace, and see which state in the United States produces the most NBA players. I will also use another dataset created by Gabe Salzer (https://data.world/gmoney/nba-team-records-by-year) to analyze the win ratio that each team had throughout the team's history, and to see if there was a correlation between the team with the most wins being the NBA champions of that season. I also intend on using a dataset created by Tristian Malherbe on data.world (https://data.world/datatouille/nba-finals-and-mvps) to analyze the NBA Finals matchups, champions, win ratio, and finals MVP. Lastly, I will create visuals for these different categories through Tableau.

### Scholarship

The NBA is one of the American sports league with a notable historic background. There are many works by authors that focus on racism in the NBA, as the blacks players are often stereotyped as "high-salaried drug-sniffing black guys" (Agyemang and Singer 2014), how they were initially underpaid compared to white players (Koch and Vander Hill 1988), and how the black player-white team owner relationship is similar to the black slave-white slave owner relationship. Furthermore, as the NBA was originally an all-white league, Bill Russell, the first black NBA superstar, helped integrate black athletes with white athletes in the NBA (Nelson 2005, Goudsouzian 2006). Many authors that have written about Bill Russell's significant contribution believe that this was one of the major stepping stones in the development of the modern NBA, as the majority of the players are black. Bill Russell wasn't the only person to help integrate non-white races into the NBA, as many authors believe that Yao Ming was a huge influencer in bringing Asians into the NBA and popularizing basketball in Asia (Farred 2006, Keeler and Nauright 2005). Lastly, other authors have focused on the capitalistic side of basketball, as Michael Jordan essentially made millions of dollars off of his signature shoes, thus giving other atheletes such as Kobe Bryant and LeBron James an opportunity to make money from things other than their regular NBA salary (LeFeber 1999).
