REPLACE THE INTRO IMAGE WITH ANY IMAGE YOU WISH, OR PUT IMAGES ANYWHERE ELSE,
IF YOU LIKE.

---

REMEMBER TO USE THE [Markdown Cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

FOR ALL EXTERNAL LINKS OR IMAGES, JUST PAST THE URL INSIDE THE PARENTHESES

FOR LOCAL LINKS OR IMAGES, ALL PATHS START FROM THE `docs` DIRECTORY. SO TO
LINK TO ANY IMAGE YOU STORED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE `imgs` DIRECTORY, YOU ONLY
NEED TO MAKE THE PATH LIKE THIS `imgs/some_image.jpg`. NOTE: YOU SHOULD *NOT*
START PATHS WITH A `/`. See the examples above.

WHEN COMPOSING YOUR PROPOSAL REMEMBER YOU CAN...

* Remember that you can...
* Put items in lists
* Even
    * Nested
    * Lists

1. You can also
2. Use numbered
    1. Lists
    2. And Nest them

---

Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

---

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

```

Dr Dave Thomas



This project is an attempt to understand the language and rhetoric of American Presidential speeches throughout history. Specifically, we intend to analyze and compare the differences in topic, grammar, and length by using Inaugural Addresses and State of the Union Addresses. Through a comparison of these subjects in the corresponding texts, we hope to gain an understanding of how newly elected presidents spoke to the nation just after taking office, and their realities after leading the country for a year. This work could be used to understand changes in work of the presidency and efficacy of leadership.


### Introduction

The goals for the project are mainly to gain a deeper understanding of the ‘Language of the Presidency’ so as to better understand how the role has changed over time. The analytical tools allow a rich view of how word choices and subject matter have subtle differences between each President; We can then use that understanding to gain more insight into the experiences of the country under that leaders guidance. This is just a small section of written text intended to persuade audiences of voters and comes with all biases, intended or not. It is an important section to understand because it will provide a basis towards further analysis of much larger texts pertaining to all facets of governmental operations.

### Workflow

Our data source comes from the American Presidency Project which is hosted by the University of California, Santa Barbara. It is a collection of digitised documents, data, and other statistics pertaining to the presidency, and includes full text publications of every president’s speeches. Every president’s Inaugural and Union Address from George Washington to Donald Trump, easily searchable and indexed in a well documented way. The site also includes data about many aspects of the presidency, which includes Approval Ratings, Executive branch growth, and some voter records. This will serve as a solid foundation from which to build out more research on the subject.

We shall first use webscraper to datamine all the speeches into a plaintext csv. Using a bit of python code and programs developed by Professor Thomas we are able to separate each speech into its own .txt file, which will be usable for other analysis tools. We can then use tools like Voyant and OverviewDocs to index and search for prominent subjects and word groupings among the varying presidents. These can serve as the basis for some visualization work in Tableau. If time permits we could work on using more in-depth text analysis work within Python. After the text has been analyzed we can use supplementary data such as yearly approval ratings change, election results, and changes in the executive branch to further understand how the office grew and matured. This data can be analyzed with programs such as Gephi and Raw and further presented with the visualizations from Tableau.
