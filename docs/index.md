REPLACE THE INTRO IMAGE WITH ANY IMAGE YOU WISH, OR PUT IMAGES ANYWHERE ELSE,
IF YOU LIKE.

REMEMBER TO USE THE [Markdown Cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

FOR ALL EXTERNAL LINKS OR IMAGES, JUST PAST THE URL INSIDE THE PARENTHESES

FOR LOCAL LINKS OR IMAGES, ALL PATHS START FROM THE `docs` DIRECTORY. SO TO
LINK TO ANY IMAGE YOU STORED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE `imgs` DIRECTORY, YOU ONLY
NEED TO MAKE THE PATH LIKE THIS `imgs/some_image.jpg`. NOTE: YOU SHOULD *NOT*
START PATHS WITH A `/`. See the examples above.

WHEN COMPOSING YOUR PROPOSAL REMEMBER YOU CAN...

* Remember that you can...
* Put items in lists
* Even
    * Nested
    * Lists

1. You can also
2. Use numbered
    1. Lists
    2. And Nest them

---

Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

---

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

```

## The Proposal

### Introduction

For this research project, I would like to explore the subject of Medal of Honor recipients in the United States Military. I think that this topic can be quite interesting to research, given that I have not had much exposure to the various Medal of Honor recipients and their acts of bravery. I feel that the other group members and I can learn much about this topic through this research project. Some different questions I would like to have answered through this project are: “During which conflict was the Medal of Honor awarded the most?”, “Which branch if the United States Military included the most recipients of the Medal?”, “Which states had the most Medal recipients as their residents?”. There may be more questions which I would like to explore, but these are just a few ideas. 

I think that the reader should care about this project because of the interesting stories can be learned of Medal of Honor recipients.

### Workflow

The main data source which I would like to utilize for this project is the website for the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. This website is the society’s official website. This is a database which includes individual webpage/profiles for each recipient of the Medal of Honor. Each profile includes certain information about the recipient such as birthdate, birthplace, the date of the issue of the Medal, and more. The website is also divided into categories such as Living Recipients, Recent Recipients, and Double Recipients. There is much useful information on this website, and it serves as a very adequate database for functions such as web scraping and creating visuals on Tableau. The web scraper and Tableau are two tools which I would like to use in order to obtain the information and visualize it. As far as the job of each group member, one person can scrape the information from the website while another can experiment with different Tableau visuals. Those are just two examples on how each group member can help.
