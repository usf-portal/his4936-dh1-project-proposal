# Proposal
	
Our group’s research topic is the Warsaw Uprising (Polish: Powstanie Warszawskie) that occurred during World War II. The 

Uprising began on 1 August 1944 and ended on 2 October 1944 furthermore, it was a major part of a nationwide operation 

referred to as "Operation Tempest", launched at the time of the Soviet Lublin–Brest Offensive. The main Polish objectives were 

to drive the Germans out of Warsaw while helping the Allies defeat Germany. The Uprising was expected to last about a week and 

was seen largely as a “mopping-up” operation; however, it turned out to be a miscalculation. The Germans decided to make a 

stand and defend “fortress” Warsaw as the Soviets halted their offensive. The uprising lasted not one but nine weeks, turning 

into the longest and bloodiest urban insurgency of the Second World War.

# The questions we want to explore:

Who were the eyewitnesses? Soldiers/ Civilians

Where were the German strategic positions in Warsaw?

What kind of weapons were used by the Polish Home Army (Polish: Armia Krajowa)?

The timeline of the Uprising, with the emphasis on the witness accounts. 
	
As of today, we will be using the Warsaw Uprising website http://www.warsawuprising.com/index.htm, and in particular “the eye 

witness” account page from the Polish and German perspective. We plan to use the Webscraper program to gather the information, 

format-it through Atom / Open Refine, and plug-in the data into Orange3 and/or Gephi. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the 

data gathered from the Warsaw Uprising eye witness accounts can be put through the network analysis widget in Orange3 and 

create a network visual. Gephi will be used as a secondary tool for primarily network analysis of the data gathered from the 

eyewitness accounts.

Group Leader Mike (Michal) is going to use GitHub as a repository for all the research data and formatting, Tableau for 

creating visual data perspective, and Atom/ Open Refine for formatting the information collected. Norberto will use Webscraper 

to gather the data from websites and Orange3 and/or Gephi to also create network visual data analysis perspective.

REPLACE THE INTRO IMAGE WITH ANY IMAGE YOU WISH, OR PUT IMAGES ANYWHERE ELSE,
IF YOU LIKE.

REMEMBER TO USE THE [Markdown Cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

FOR ALL EXTERNAL LINKS OR IMAGES, JUST PAST THE URL INSIDE THE PARENTHESES

FOR LOCAL LINKS OR IMAGES, ALL PATHS START FROM THE `docs` DIRECTORY. SO TO
LINK TO ANY IMAGE YOU STORED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE `imgs` DIRECTORY, YOU ONLY
NEED TO MAKE THE PATH LIKE THIS `imgs/some_image.jpg`. NOTE: YOU SHOULD *NOT*
START PATHS WITH A `/`. See the examples above.

WHEN COMPOSING YOUR PROPOSAL REMEMBER YOU CAN...

* Remember that you can...
* Put items in lists
* Even
    * Nested
    * Lists

1. You can also
2. Use numbered
    1. Lists
    2. And Nest them

---

Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

---

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

```

## The Proposal

### Introduction

The introduction should let the reader know why they should care about the
topic in general, and to the extent you are able at this time, what you are
going to say (or ask about) that topic. Use the introduction to let the
reader know basic facts, or to inform them (briefly)

Even where you are not sure of exactly where you are going. Try to give the
reader (namely, me) an idea about the the context of the problem or question
you are going to tackle. Above all, you should let the reader know
**why they should care**.

---

### Workflow

When are where you think you might use certain information sources, let the
reader know which sources of information you are going to use, and how you
intend to get information from that source in a useable format.

Next, to whatever extent possible, let the reader understand how you envision
the overall workflow. That is, how do you intend to get from a to z. At this
stage, you probably have a lot of uncertainties, but you should try to think
this out as much as possible. What tool(s) do you intend to use for scraping?
For cleaning, visualizing? Will you have to transform the data into different
formats, if so how? How ensure that group members are not constantly waiting
on a single member to complete their phase? Can you think of ways that group
members can get updates in advance of the finished work, so that they can
start their own work?

---

### Scholarship

Here is where you should expand a bit on any relevant scholarship, whether
digital or historical. If you refer to authors in your bibliography, you need
only use parenthetical (author, year) notation. If you are referring to a web
resource, you can always link directly to it.

This section should not be a large histiographical essay going on about the
merits or drawbacks of different individuals. That kind of discussion can go
in your final project. Instead, this should be a place to let your reader know
in the space of several paragraphs the basic schools of thought or important
works of scholarship that relate to your project. More importantly, you can
suggest what (potentially) a digital project such as the one you are proposing
could say to such a debate.

Remember that you can and should talk about both digital and historical
scholarship, when relevant. [Digital Humanities Quarterly](www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/)
is a good starting point.

Rather than think of this as a discussion about others, it might be more
helpful to think of it like this: in academia there are lots of scattered, but
important conversations going on, you can have more impact when you can connect
what you are saying to more and more of these conversations. So, you can think
of it like selling your project by linking it to its possible links to others.
