REPLACE THE INTRO IMAGE WITH ANY IMAGE YOU WISH, OR PUT IMAGES ANYWHERE ELSE,
IF YOU LIKE.

---

REMEMBER TO USE THE [Markdown Cheatsheet here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

FOR ALL EXTERNAL LINKS OR IMAGES, JUST PAST THE URL INSIDE THE PARENTHESES

FOR LOCAL LINKS OR IMAGES, ALL PATHS START FROM THE `docs` DIRECTORY. SO TO
LINK TO ANY IMAGE YOU STORED DIRECTLY INSIDE THE `imgs` DIRECTORY, YOU ONLY
NEED TO MAKE THE PATH LIKE THIS `imgs/some_image.jpg`. NOTE: YOU SHOULD *NOT*
START PATHS WITH A `/`. See the examples above.

WHEN COMPOSING YOUR PROPOSAL REMEMBER YOU CAN...

* Remember that you can...
* Put items in lists
* Even
    * Nested
    * Lists

1. You can also
2. Use numbered
    1. Lists
    2. And Nest them

---

Use triple dashes (like below) to separate sections of your text

---

Remember you can use `single backticks` to quote code inline, or use triple
backticks to make a blockquote of code (you can even specify the language,
if you want).

```markdown

# Quoted Markdown

When this is put on the web this will appear in the in raw Markdown. That is,
this will appear inside a code blockquote, this will not be rendered as
part of the webpage. Instead, it will look very similar to how you are seeing
it now, inside the editor.

You can do this for pretty much any language or format we
have run into for this class...

* python
* csv
* json
* et.c.

```

## The Proposal
Proposal and Bibliography:
Revolutions and Rebellions
Stephen DeCasien, Lauren Leigh, and Mikey Hall

Project Proposal:

Our teams' research project will consist of comparing and contrasting three distinct revolutions. These revolutions are the Cuban Revolution (Stephen DeCasien), the Russian Revolution (Lauren Leigh) and the French Revolution (Mikey Hall). Each member of the team will collect a myriad of data on their chosen revolution. This data will consist of information pertaining to the timespan of the revolution with relevant events included (places of battles, revolts etc.), the economic data pre- and post-revolution, the death toll (both military and civilian during the timespan of each revolution), and the impact of political groups/regimes concerning elections and attainments of power (through the examination of elections and speeches).
---
The questions that we strive to answer are as follows: What are the factors that lead up to each revolution? Were there economic factors involved in the reason for revolution or some that may have happened in the process which changed the state of that revolution? Can these economic factors be somehow compared between each revolution? What are the political factors of the revolution? Is there a complete change in government regimes or a simple change in governmental systems?  What was their political organization and problems that led to these revolutions? Can we see any commonality through speeches and language used by revolutionary leaders that are similar in each revolution (using translated speeches)? What was the human cost of each revolution? Does the timespan and scope have a factor in the brutality, economic change and political pressures at the end of each revolution?
---
Our data sources differ from amongst each team member. For example, for the Cuban Revolution the information comes from archives from both the United States and Cuban governments. Some information comes from websites that have collected data on some various aspect of the revolution like deaths and economic material. For general guidance on basic historical background and timelines, a multitude of books, articles and Wikipedia will be consulted. By using tools like webscraper, openrefine, voyant, and tableau each group member will create their own dataset/visualizations to be compared against one another. Eventfully, each dataset/visualization will be checked by each member for accuracy and consistency. Finally, resulting in a comparative project involving our three similar, yet distinct revolutions.
