# American Casualties in WWII


## The Proposal

### Introduction

Our research topic is American WW2 casualties by military branch and by U.S. state. We would like to explore some interesting questions of which states contained the most casualties in the war as well as which branches of the military. There are a few other questions or nuances that we are hoping can brought up through visualizations that we would otherwise not be able to see or answer without such methods. We are also thinking about adding in a few other casualty databases from other countries involved in the war to use as a reference for comparison. Lastly, we will attempt to gather sources on some of the battles of WWII with the heaviest casualties for Americans and connect it to the overall casualty count as well as traditional scholarship on why certain battles didn’t go in American soldiers’ favor such as the invasion of Normandy, the Battle of the Buldge, Okinawa, etc. 
**why they should care**.

### Workflow

Since it is just two of us we intend on sharing the work as a whole and working on the same things together vs. splitting the work into a traditional print scholarship role and digital role, if that is okay. I can make updates to this section if you would like a concrete list of who will do what.

### Scholarship

Our main data source is the National Archives (Archives.gov). Unfortunately, the records of every US casualty are a screen shot of pages from an actual book of records. Therefore, we plan on manually entering the final tally number of casualties from each US state into an excel spreadsheet by hand. After doing so, we will play around with some visualization tools like tableau, ghephi, orange, etc. The overall goal is to show some cool visualizations of the casualties suffered in WWII on backgrounds such as maps or counties in a way that can hit home with an audience a little harder than the traditional and one-dimensional “body count” statistic.
