## The Proposal

### Introduction
 
The state of Florida and particularly Tampa, is experiencing an extreme lack of medical personnel. A major factor in this predicament stems from a polarization in worker availabilty due to access to education. A trending issue in todays workforce, lack of education is creating a large manual labor employee pool. While analytical positions are behind an education barrier, creating a much smaller pool of employees. By accessing the census data for Tampa, Florida, we fully expect to see a correlation between achieved degrees and household income. Due to the extreme need for Nursing personnel in the state of Florida, we fully expect to see a large ammount education tracking into medical professions.

### Scholarship

The main source being used is dataus.io. This website takes raw census data and makes it visual and easier to absorb for the average person. The About section explains this site was formed by a collection of data scientists, economists, business professionals and public employees. By using this census data, they intend to “understand and visualize the critical issues facing the United States in areas like jobs, skills and education across industry and geography.” (dataus.io, 2018)

While Nick Nail was analyzing the visualizations from dataus.io, the areas that stuck out as most intriguing were education trends and the labor market. From the years 2013 to 2016, there were constant upward and downward shifts in various fields. The largest change in this short time period was the increase of Nursing and healthcare degrees. By noticing that change, there was a question of, is there a similar correlation in the job market? Both Nick Nail and classmate Chris Volk began researching articles and journals to further explain these trends. 

From a local Tampa news article, there is a large shortage of Nurses and Healthcare professionals across the entire country. This issue is specific to Florida from the higher numbers of elderly and the constant population growth of those moving to the state. (tampabay.com, 2016) Volk was able to take the data provided and test visualizations specific to this topic. He will continue to create different configurations in Tableau with the purpose of uncovering any non-obvious associations. Nail plans to use the research from the articles and compare to the visualizations from Chris Volk.
